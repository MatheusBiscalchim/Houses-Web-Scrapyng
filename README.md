Web Scraping Project with Selenium for Data Collection on a House sales Website

In this project, I will demonstrate how to utilize the Selenium library for web scraping on a house sales website. Selenium is an ideal choice for this task as it enables dynamic interaction and navigation on the site, mimicking actions similar to those of a regular user.

Key Features:

Site Interaction: Leveraging Selenium, we can perform actions such as clicking on elements, logging in, and interacting with the site like a real user.

Opening New Tabs: The project includes the ability to open new tabs during navigation to access different sections of the site.

Collecting Data from Cards: By clicking on specific cards (e.g., houses listings), the script accesses and collects relevant data present on those pages.

Dynamic Tab Closure: After collecting data from a tab, the script dynamically closes the open tab, optimizing the process and freeing up resources.

Looping Through the Site: The project is structured to iterate through the site in a loop, repeating the process of opening tabs, interaction, and data collection until a final database is constructed.

Usage Instructions:

Dependency Installation: Ensure that Selenium is installed. You can do so by running the command pip install selenium.

WebDriver Configuration: Configure the Selenium WebDriver for your chosen browser (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver).

Script Execution: Run the main script to initiate the web scraping process. Make sure to adjust URLs and selectors as needed.

Results: The collected data will be stored in a final database, ready for analysis or further processing.

I hope this project proves helpful for your data collection needs on a car rental website. Feel free to customize and expand as required.
